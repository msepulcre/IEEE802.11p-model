    % Parameters of the radio propagation model:
    fc = 5.89e9;                % Carrier frequency (Hz)
    hBS = 1.5;                  % Transmitter antenna height (m)
    hMS = 1.5;                  % Receiver antenna height (m)
    environmentHeight = 0.5;    % Average environmental height (m)
    distance = abs(distance);

    c = 3e8;
    dBP = 4 * (hBS-environmentHeight) * (hMS-environmentHeight) * fc / c; % breakpoint distance

    % Avoid errors for very small distances:
    i = find(distance < 3);
    distance(i) = 3;

    % Calculate pathloss for distances lower than the breakpoint distance:
    i = find(distance < dBP);
    PL(i) = 22.7*log10(distance(i)) + 27 + 20*log10(fc/1e9);
    std_dev(i) = 3;    % Standard deviation

    % Calculate pathloss for distances higher than the breakpoint distance:
    i = find(distance >= dBP);
    PL(i) = 40*log10(distance(i)) + 7.56 - 17.3*log10(hBS-environmentHeight) - 17.3*log10(hMS-environmentHeight) + 2.7*log10(fc/1e9);
    std_dev(i) = 3;    % Standard deviation

    % Compares obtained pathloss with free-space pathloss:
    PLfree = 20*log10(distance) + 46.4 + 20*log10(fc*1e-9 / 5);
